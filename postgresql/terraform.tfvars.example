# To further reduce costs, consider:
# - Setting max_capacity to 2.0 only if you need burst capacity
# - Aurora Serverless v2 automatically scales down when not in use
# - Backup retention is set to 1 day (minimum) to reduce storage costs
# - Storage encryption is disabled to avoid additional charges
# - Enhanced monitoring is disabled to avoid extra costs
